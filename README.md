## Matchers included

### `toMatchSchema(schema)`

Validates that an object matches the given [JSON schema](http://json-schema.org/)

```js
it('validates my json', () => {
  const schema = {
    properties: {
      hello: { type: 'string' },
    },
    required: ['hello'],
  };
  expect({ hello: 'world' }).toMatchSchema(schema);
});
```

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev jest-json-schema
```

## Usage

In any test file:

```js
import { matchers } from 'jest-json-schema';
expect.extend(matchers);
```

Or if you want it available for all test files then set it up the same way in a
[test framework script file](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/configuration.html#setuptestframeworkscriptfile-string)

You can pass [Ajv options](http://epoberezkin.github.io/ajv/#options) using
`matchersWithOptions` and passing it your options object. The only option passed
by default is `allErrors: true`.

```js
import { matchersWithOptions } from 'jest-json-schema';

const formats = {
  bcp47: /^[a-z]{2}-[A-Z]{2}$/,
}

expect.extend(matchersWithOptions({ formats }));
```

Additionally you can also use a callback to further configure the Ajv
instance, which is run after the `new Ajv(ajvOptions)` is executed
and passes the Ajv instance as a single parameter:

```js
import ajvKeywords from 'ajv-keywords';
import { matchersWithOptions } from 'jest-json-schema';

const formats = {
  bcp47: /^[a-z]{2}-[A-Z]{2}$/,
}

expect.extend(matchersWithOptions({ formats }, ajv => {
  ajvKeywords(ajv, ['typeof', 'instanceof']);
}));
```
